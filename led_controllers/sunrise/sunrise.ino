// the idea of this file is to build a lights animation that runs on < 150 leds, where over the period of 30 minutes 3 dots spawn:
// yellow, red to blue or something. they move slowly and can blend inbetween pixels (subpixel rendering)
// when they move along the strip they pull the led target value closer to their own which chould also be a way
// of morphing between their own values. 
// this strip will be mounted under the bed ;)



void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
